My project is a Password Manager built with React, designed to securely store and manage passwords for different websites and applications. It provides a simple, user-friendly interface with the following key features:

Adding Passwords: The app allows users to input essential details like email, password, username, website URL, and the date of creation for each password.
Displaying Data: The entered information is displayed in a card layout, making it easy to view stored passwords in an organized manner.
Delete Functionality: Users can delete specific password entries from the list when necessary, giving them full control over their stored data.
Toast Notifications: After submitting a password, a toast notification appears to confirm that the password was stored successfully.
The app's design ensures that users can easily navigate between different sections, making it accessible for individuals with varying technical backgrounds. Form validation prevents users from submitting empty values, ensuring that all required fields are filled out before submission.

This project is purely frontend, meaning it does not have a backend. All the data is temporarily stored within the application itself, making it ideal for personal use, though itâ€™s not designed for large-scale or persistent data storage. This keeps the app lightweight and simple while focusing on providing a smooth, responsive experience.

By using React's hooks, state management, and the react-toastify library for notifications, the app ensures smooth user interactions and real-time feedback. It is a basic password manager that focuses on ease of use and effective data management without the need for complex server-side integration.
